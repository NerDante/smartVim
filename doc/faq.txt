1. how to generate compile_commands.json for clangd?

- use cmake to build project:
    Add set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON) in your CMakeLists.txt
- use Makefile build project:
    Install compiledb which is developed with python:
    $ pip install compiledb
    Run "compiledb -n make" in your project root:
    $ compiledb -n make

2. switch complete engine between coc and deoplete
    just set autocomplete_engine in vimrc: 
    let autocomplete_engine="coc"
    or 
    let autocomplete_engine="deoplete"
